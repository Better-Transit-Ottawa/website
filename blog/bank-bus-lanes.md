From 18h30 to 20h30 tonight, Ottawa staff held an open house to put forward their recommendations for bus lanes and street parking changes on bank street. 

What the citizens of Ottawa received can be described as nothing short of a insult.

## Changes

On Wednesday, September 24th, 2025, the City of Ottawa held an open house to present their recommendations for Bus Lanes on Bank street. The proposed changes included:
- A 2-hour bus lane in the morning rush from 07h00 to 09h00 for northbound traffic **only**, ending at Pretoria and starting at Holmwood. 
- A 2-hour bus lane in the afternoon from 15h30 to 17h30 for southbound traffic **only**, starting at Powell. 
- Five small 24h bus lanes segments added at the intersection at Fifth Road, with the longest section able to accommodate 2 articulated buses, with the other sections on the western side of Bank across from Lansdowne from Holmwood to Wilton, and on the north side of back before Aylmer.
- A single transit signal priority added at the Exhibition intersection.
- Addition of 3 bike crossings at Glebe, First, and Fifth intersection.

Street parking would be allowed outside of these times, and major TD place events. 

These changes were not proposed as interim or temporary.

## Parking
Parked cars disproportionately affect all users of a transportation corridor, with even a single parked car causing danger to hundreds of people as traffic must weave around them, while adding little value to the surrounding area - most commonly used by business owners who arrive earlier than all other customers. 

There are 143 street parking spaces on this section of Bank, making up a total of 7% of the study area's total parking capacity by the city's own figure, with the three parking garages within the study area never reaching parking capacity outside of events at TD place - sitting at an average use of 30%.

City staff acknowledged that illegal parking during disallowed times (peak rush and events) was a common occurrence. When questioned were raised regarding enforcement, city staff claimed higher fees for infractions as a result of a change to bus lanes was their plan, but declined to comment when questioned why that did not work for the Rideau street bus lanes.

## Buses
City staff quoted 6000 daily bus riders alone, with the combined 6 and 7 bus routes being the busiest route in the city. These routes are often some of, if not the most, unreliable buses according to data released by OC Transpo, and can be found delayed, cancelled, and/or bunched consistently throughout the entire day - not just peak hours. 

The city claimed these changes would decrease travel times for bus commuters by up to 60 seconds (a bus that is frequently delayed by 20 minutes or more) but would only do so during peak times. City staff also claimed that it would increase consistency and reliability, but gave no figure or scale as to how much of an impact this would have, nor did they comment on how much complete 24h bus lanes would benefit riders.

## Conclusion
Thousands of people should not have to be disproportionately affected both in terms of their own commutes as well as their safety in order to save seconds of walking for a handful of people, which was claimed by city staff as a "balanced compromise". Does that sound balanced to you?

The proposed measures are completely and utterly inadequate for all users of Bank Street, with absolutely no indication of ever being improved in the future.

The citizens of Ottawa all deserve better.
